* Till now I have added the basic authentication along with the user schema and also a function to update the user details.

**NOTE**
When the user creates an account or logs in the only use - name, email and password. 
So all the other details in the schema needs to be added separately. And that is exactly why I created the update function to update the user details.

**API END-POINTS**
Account creation - /api/auth/register
User Login - /api/auth/login
Adding/updating user details - /api/user/add-details
