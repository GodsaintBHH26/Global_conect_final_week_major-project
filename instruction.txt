* Till now I have added the basic authentication along with the user schema and also a function to update the user details.

**NOTE**
When the user creates an account or logs in the only use - name, email and password. 
So all the other details in the schema needs to be added separately. And that is exactly why I created the update function to update the user details.

**API END-POINTS**
Account creation - /api/auth/register
User Login - /api/auth/login
Adding/updating user details - /api/user/add-details

**By Akriti Sharma**
I've created utils folder where I create a file "generateToken" in oder to generate a jsonWebToken.
After that I've install dependencies like multer,socket.io , cloudinary and nodemon

I've futher created models like post,message and Job...

then create a file "multer.js" in utils folder...

update the userController...

create postController....

* Fixed the errors
* PUT api/user/add-details is a route I set to add the basic details like - user education, experience, skills etc. Please don't remove this function. We are not taking these details while the user account is created, instead we add these details when the user account is created.

**NOTE**
please read and try to understand the already written code in the file you're trying to work on.
